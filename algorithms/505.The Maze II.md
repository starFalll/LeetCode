### [505. The Maze II](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze-ii/)

There is a ball in a `maze` with empty spaces (represented as `0`) and walls (represented as `1`). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling **up, down, left or right**, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the `m x n` `maze`, the ball's `start` position and the `destination`, where `start = [startrow, startcol]` and `destination = [destinationrow, destinationcol]`, return *the shortest **distance** for the ball to stop at the destination*. If the ball cannot stop at `destination`, return `-1`.

The **distance** is the number of **empty spaces** traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included).

You may assume that **the borders of the maze are all walls** (see examples).

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/31/maze1-1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: maze = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0]], start = [0,4], destination = [4,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: One possible way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right -> down -> right.
The length of the path is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/31/maze1-2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: maze = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0]], start = [0,4], destination = [3,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination. Notice that you can pass through the destination but you cannot stop there.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0]], start = [4,3], destination = [0,1]
Output: -1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == maze.length`
- `n == maze[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `maze[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
- `start.length == 2`
- `destination.length == 2`
- `0 <= startrow, destinationrow < m`
- `0 <= startcol, destinationcol < n`
- Both the ball and the destination exist in an empty space, and they will not be in the same position initially.
- The maze contains **at least 2 empty spaces**.

#### Solution

BFS+use an extra matrix to store the shortest path at (row, col).

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<vector<int>>& maze, vector<int>& start, vector<int>& destination) {
        vector<vector<int>> records(maze.size(), vector<int>(maze[0].size(), INT_MAX));
        records[start[0]][start[1]] = 0;
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({start[0], start[1]});
        vector<int> next = {0, -1, 0, 1, 0};
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [row, col] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                int r = row + next[i];
                int c = col + next[i+1];
                while (r >= 0 && r < maze.size() 
                    && c >= 0 && c < maze[0].size() && maze[r][c] == 0) {
                        r = r + next[i];
                        c = c + next[i+1];
                    }
                r = r - next[i];
                c = c - next[i+1];
                int distance = abs(row-r)+abs(col-c);
                if (records[r][c] > records[row][col] + distance) {
                    records[r][c] = records[row][col] + distance;
                    q.push({r, c});
                }
            }
        }
        return records[destination[0]][destination[1]] == INT_MAX ? -1 : records[destination[0]][destination[1]];
    }
};
