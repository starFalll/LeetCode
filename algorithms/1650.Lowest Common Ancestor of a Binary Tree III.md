### [1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/)

Given two nodes of a binary tree `p` and `q`, return *their lowest common ancestor (LCA)*.

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for `Node` is below:

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
```

According to the **[definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor)**: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` exist in the tree.

#### Solution

first , get root from p / q, record the path

second from two path, find the lowest common one.

Time complexity:O(logn)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    Node* lowestCommonAncestor(Node* p, Node * q) {
        stack<int> sp, sq;
        Node* root = nullptr;
        while (p) {
            sp.push(p->val);
            root = p;
            p = p->parent;
        }
        while (q) {
            sq.push(q->val);
            q = q->parent;
        }
        Node* res = root;
        while (sp.size() && sq.size()) {
            sp.pop();sq.pop();
            if (sp.size() && sq.size() && sp.top() == sq.top()) {
                if (res->left && res->left->val == sp.top()) res = res->left;
                else res = res->right;
            }
            else break;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
