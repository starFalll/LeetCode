### 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

- For example, if `words = ["ab","cd","ef"]`, then `"abcdef"`, `"abefcd"`, `"cdabef"`, `"cdefab"`, `"efabcd"`, and `"efcdab"` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef"` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return *the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in* `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
Explanation: Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.
```

**Example 3**

```
Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
Output: [6,9,12]
Explanation: Since words.length == 3 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.
```



**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

#### Solution

HashMap解决，但是有个特殊case会超时，特殊处理了下。

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findSubstring(string s, vector<string>& words) {
        unordered_map<string, int> tables;
        if (s.size() < words.size()) return {};
        int len = words[0].size();
        int total_len = len * words.size();
        for (auto& word : words) tables[word]++;
        vector<int> res;
        int begin = 0;
        // special case
        if (len == 1 && tables[words[0]] == words.size()) {
            int cur = begin;
            for (; cur < begin + total_len; cur++) {
                if (s[cur] != words[0][0]) break;
            }
            if (cur == begin + total_len) {
                res.push_back(begin);
                begin++;
                while (cur < s.size() && s[cur] == words[0][0]) {
                    res.push_back(begin);
                    cur++;
                    begin++;
                }
                if (cur == s.size()) return res;
            }
        }
        begin = 0;
        res.clear();
        while (begin + total_len - 1 < s.size()) {
            unordered_map<string, int> visited;
            int cnt = 0;
            
            while (cnt < words.size()) {
                auto str = s.substr(begin + len*cnt, len);
                if (tables.find(str) != tables.end() && visited[str] < tables[str]) {
                    visited[str]++;
                    cnt++;
                }
                else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (cnt == words.size()) {
                res.push_back(begin);
            }
            begin++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
