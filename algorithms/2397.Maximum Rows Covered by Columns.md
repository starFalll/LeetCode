### [2397. Maximum Rows Covered by Columns](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-rows-covered-by-columns/)

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `matrix` and an integer `numSelect`.

Your goal is to select exactly `numSelect` **distinct** columns from `matrix` such that you cover as many rows as possible.

A row is considered **covered** if all the `1`'s in that row are also part of a column that you have selected. If a row does not have any `1`s, it is also considered covered.

More formally, let us consider `selected = {c1, c2, ...., cnumSelect}` as the set of columns selected by you. A row `i` is **covered** by `selected` if:

- For each cell where `matrix[i][j] == 1`, the column `j` is in `selected`.
- Or, no cell in row `i` has a value of `1`.

Return the **maximum** number of rows that can be **covered** by a set of `numSelect` columns.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]], numSelect = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.
We choose s = {0, 2}.
\- Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.
\- Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.
\- Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.
\- Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s.
Thus, we can cover three rows.
Note that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered.

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/07/14/rowscovered2.png)

**Input:** matrix = [[1],[0]], numSelect = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

Selecting the only column will result in both rows being covered since the entire matrix is selected.

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 12`
- `matrix[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `1 <= numSelect <= n`

#### Solution

DFS

Time complexity: O(n!)

Space complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countCovered(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, unordered_set<int>& selects) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].size(); j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1 && 0 == selects.count(j)) break;
                cnt++;
            }
            if (cnt == matrix[0].size()) res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
    void DFS(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int numSelect, 
        int idx, unordered_set<int>& selects, int& res) {
        // the remaining columns are not enough
        if (matrix[0].size()-idx < numSelect - selects.size()) return;
        if (numSelect == selects.size()) {
            res = max(res, countCovered(matrix, selects));
            return;
        }
        for (int i = idx; i < matrix[0].size(); i++) {
            selects.insert(i);
            DFS(matrix, numSelect, i+1, selects, res);
            selects.erase(i);
        }
    }
    int maximumRows(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int numSelect) {
        if (numSelect >= matrix[0].size()) return matrix.size();
        unordered_set<int> selects;
        int res = 0;
        DFS(matrix, numSelect, 0, selects, res);
        return res;
    }
};
