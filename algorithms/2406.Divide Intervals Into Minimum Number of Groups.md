### [2406. Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-intervals-into-minimum-number-of-groups/)

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` represents the **inclusive** interval `[lefti, righti]`.

You have to divide the intervals into one or more **groups** such that each interval is in **exactly** one group, and no two intervals that are in the same group **intersect** each other.

Return *the **minimum** number of groups you need to make*.

Two intervals **intersect** if there is at least one common number between them. For example, the intervals `[1, 5]` and `[5, 8]` intersect.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[5,10],[6,8],[1,5],[2,3],[1,10]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can divide the intervals into the following groups:
- Group 1: [1, 5], [6, 8].
- Group 2: [2, 3], [5, 10].
- Group 3: [1, 10].
It can be proven that it is not possible to divide the intervals into fewer than 3 groups.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10],[11,13]]
Output: 1
Explanation: None of the intervals overlap, so we can put all of them in one group.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 106`

#### Solution

quicksort + binary search

use a map to store the last number of each group

each time we try to find the number that < cur interval's begin, the cur interval will belong to that group

use lower_bound, then we use the --it to find the group that cur interval belongs to

if it == begin, means we can not find the group, so res++

Time complexity: O(nlog)

Space complexity: O(n)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minGroups(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
        map<int, int> m;
        m.insert({intervals[0][1], 1});
        int res = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            auto& interval = intervals[i];
            auto it = m.lower_bound(interval[0]);
            // find the interval not intersect
            if (it != m.begin()) {
                --it;
                it->second--;
                if (it->second == 0) {
                    m.erase(it);
                }
                m[interval[1]]++;
            }
            // must intersect
            else {
                m[interval[1]]++;
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
