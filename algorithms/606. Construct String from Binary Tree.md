### [606. Construct String from Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/)

Given the `root` node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Node Representation**: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.

- **Parentheses for Children**: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:

  - If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.
  - If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.

- **Omitting Empty Parentheses**: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., `()`) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.

  In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/cons1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/cons2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except the () after 2 is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for 2 and the presence of a right child.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

#### Solution

Recursion.

#### Code

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    string tree2str(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return "";
        string left = tree2str(root->left);
        string right = tree2str(root->right);
        string res = to_string(root->val);
        if (!left.empty() || !right.empty()) {
            res += "(" + left + ")";
        }
        if (!right.empty()) {
            res += "(" + right + ")";
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
