### [1268. Search Suggestions System](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/)

You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return *a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of* `searchWord` *is typed*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"].
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"].
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
Explanation: The only word "havana" will be always suggested while typing the search word.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`
- `1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 104`
- All the strings of `products` are **unique**.
- `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.

        int left = -1, right = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < searchWord.size(); i++) {
            cur += searchWord[i];
            vector<string> tmp;
            while (right < products.size() && (left == -1 || right - left < 3)) {
                if (products[right].substr(0, i+1) == cur) {
                    if (left == -1) left = right;
                    tmp.push_back(products[right]);
                    right++;
                }
                else if (left != -1) break;
                else {
                    right++;
                }
            }
            res.push_back(tmp);
            right = left;
            left = -1;
        }
        return res;
