### [802. Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/)

There is a directed graph of `n` nodes with each node labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph is represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `graph` where `graph[i]` is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node `i`, meaning there is an edge from node `i` to each node in `graph[i]`.

A node is a **terminal node** if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a **safe node** if every possible path starting from that node leads to a **terminal node** (or another safe node).

Return *an array containing all the **safe nodes** of the graph*. The answer should be sorted in **ascending** order.

 

**Example 1:**

![Illustration of graph](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/03/17/picture1.png)

```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == graph.length`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `0 <= graph[i].length <= n`
- `0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1`
- `graph[i]` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
- The graph may contain self-loops.
- The number of edges in the graph will be in the range `[1, 4 * 104]`.

#### Solution

topological sort

Time: n\*logn

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<int> out(graph.size(), 0);
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> in;
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < graph[i].size(); j++) {
                out[i]++;
                in[graph[i][j]].push_back(i);
            }
        }
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < out.size(); i++) {
            if (out[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        vector<int> res;
        while (q.size()) {
            int cur = q.front();
            res.push_back(cur);
            q.pop();
            for (auto& next : in[cur]) {
                out[next]--;
                if (out[next] == 0) {
                    q.push(next);
                }
            }
        }
        sort(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
