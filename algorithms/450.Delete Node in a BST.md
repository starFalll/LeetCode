### [450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return *the **root node reference** (possibly updated) of the BST*.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- Each node has a **unique** value.
- `root` is a valid binary search tree.
- `-105 <= key <= 105`

 

**Follow up:** Could you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?

#### Solution

Use the property of the BST and recursion.

Time Complexity: O(logn)

Space Complexity: O(logn)

#### Code

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        if (!root) return root;
        if (key < root->val) {
            root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
        }
        else if (key > root->val) {
            root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
        }
        else {
            if (!root->left) {
                return root->right;
            }
            else if (!root->right) {
                return root->left;
            }
            auto node = root->right;
            while (node->left) {
                node = node->left;
            }
            root->val = node->val;
            root->right = deleteNode(root->right, root->val);
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```
