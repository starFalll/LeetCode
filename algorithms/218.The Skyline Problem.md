### [218. The Skyline Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/)

A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return *the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively*.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

- `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
- `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
- `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points" **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/merged.jpg)

```
Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]
Output: [[0,3],[5,0]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= buildings.length <= 104`
- `0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1`
- `1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1`
- `buildings` is sorted by `lefti` in non-decreasing order.

#### Solution

将begin按照从小到大排序，end按照从小到大排序，begin对应的height从大到小排序，end对应的height从小到大排序。

然后这样就类似于room meeting问题，每次最大height有更新就添加结果。

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> getSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& buildings) {
        vector<vector<int>> tables, res;
        map<int, int> m;
        int pre = 0, cur = 0;
        for (const auto& item : buildings) {
            tables.push_back({item[0], -item[2]});
            tables.push_back({item[1], item[2]});
        }
        sort(tables.begin(), tables.end());
        m[0] = 1;
        for (const auto& item : tables) {
            if (item[1] < 0) m[-item[1]]++;
            else {
                m[item[1]]--;
                if (m[item[1]] == 0)
                    m.erase(item[1]);
            };
            cur = (*m.rbegin()).first;
            if (cur != pre) {
                res.push_back({item[0], cur});
                pre = cur;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
