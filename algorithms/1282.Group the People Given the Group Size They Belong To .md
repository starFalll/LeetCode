### [1282. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-the-people-given-the-group-size-they-belong-to/)

There are `n` people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a **unique ID** from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given an integer array `groupSizes`, where `groupSizes[i]` is the size of the group that person `i` is in. For example, if `groupSizes[1] = 3`, then person `1` must be in a group of size `3`.

Return *a list of groups such that each person `i` is in a group of size `groupSizes[i]`*.

Each person should appear in **exactly one group**, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, **return any of them**. It is **guaranteed** that there will be **at least one** valid solution for the given input.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
Output: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
Explanation: 
The first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.
The second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.
The third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.
Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]
Output: [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `groupSizes.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n`

#### Solution



#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> groupThePeople(vector<int>& groupSizes) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> m;
        int n = groupSizes.size();
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            m[groupSizes[i]].push_back(i);
            if (m[groupSizes[i]].size() >= groupSizes[i]) {
                res.push_back(m[groupSizes[i]]);
                m[groupSizes[i]].clear();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
