### [1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/)

In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return *the required force*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/11/q3v1.jpg)

```
Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
Output: 999999999
Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == position.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= position[i] <= 109`
- All integers in `position` are **distinct**.
- `2 <= m <= position.length`

#### Solution

binary search

we can use one pass to check the valid, which is O(n) time complexity.

Time complexity:O(n*logn)

Space complexity: O(1)

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool check(int mid, vector<int>& position, int m) {
        int cnt = 1;
        int target = position[0]+mid;
        for (int i = 0; i < position.size()-1; i++) {
            if (position[i] < target && position[i+1]>=target) {
                cnt++;
                target = position[i+1]+mid;
            }
        }
        return cnt >= m;
    }
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
        sort(position.begin(), position.end());
        int high = position.back() - position[0];
        int low = 1;
        int res = low;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
            // smaller or equal
            if (check(mid, position, m)) {
                res = mid;
                low = mid+1;
                
            }
            // greater
            else {
                high = mid-1;
            }

        }
        return res;
    }

};
```
