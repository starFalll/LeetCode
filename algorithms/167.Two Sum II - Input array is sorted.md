### 167.Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        vector<int> res;
        if(numbers.empty()) return res;
        int left = 0, right = numbers.size()-1;
        while(left<right)
        {
            int sum = numbers[left]+numbers[right];
            if(sum>target)
            {
                right--;
            }
            else if(sum<target)
            {
                left++;
            }
            else
            {
                res.push_back(left+1);
                res.push_back(right+1);
                return res;
            }
        }
        return res;
        
    }
};
```
