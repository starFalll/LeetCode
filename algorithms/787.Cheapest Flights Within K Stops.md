### [787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)

There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return ***the cheapest price** from* `src` *to* `dst` *with at most* `k` *stops.* If there is no such route, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-3drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
Output: 700
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-1drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-2drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `flights[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
- `fromi != toi`
- `1 <= pricei <= 104`
- There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
- `0 <= src, dst, k < n`
- `src != dst`

#### Solution

Bellman-Ford algorithm.

#### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> m;
        for (auto& flight : flights) {
            m[flight[0]].push_back({flight[1], flight[2]});
        }
        vector<int> tables(n, INT_MAX);
        vector<int> backup(n, INT_MAX);
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(src);
        int res = -1;
        tables[src] = 0;
        while (!q.empty() && k >= 0) {
            backup = tables;
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int cur = q.front();q.pop();
                for (auto& next : m[cur]) {
                    if (tables[next.first] > backup[cur] + next.second) {
                        tables[next.first] = backup[cur] + next.second;
                        q.push(next.first);
                    }
                    if (next.first == dst) {
                        res = res == -1 ? tables[next.first] : min(res, tables[next.first]);
                    }
                }
            }
            k--;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
